"""Implement a better finder to find the right argument for the function. 

Your job is to implement a function that accepts another function(call this f) and additional information(related to possible candidates) as input, and returns the argument that f returns True. 

As a hint, f will return 'up' or 'down'. When f needs larger input value to return True, it will return 'up'. Else, it will return 'down'. 

You will be asked to implement 2 finder functions; naive_finder and smart_finder. 

1) naive_finder

Function naive_finder assumes that the test function only accepts integer inputs; therefore, naive_finder can (naively) iterate all the possible candidates. It will take long - but that's why it's called naive.  Function naive_finder accepts another function f and a candidate list as input. When naive_finder is called, it iterates over all possible candidates, applies all candidates to the function one at a time, and returns when the result is True. 

naive_finder should be able to find right argument for updown_game.updown_game_easy and updown_game.updown_game_medium. 

2) smart_finder

Function smart_finder accepts another function, and the max/min value of the input for the function f. To implement the smart_finder function, think of how you actually play '업다운 게임'. 

smart_finder should be able to find right argument for updown.game.updown_game_hard and animation.check_collision.
